nodejs-json-to-csv
==================

Node.js based json to csv converter.  Usage: node coverter.js inputFile outpuFile.

This is a very simple, no frills (no real error checking) json to csv converter.

It is intended to be a command line equivalent of https://github.com/konklone/json.  It is made to run under node.js and uses the cheerio module.  Go nuts!
